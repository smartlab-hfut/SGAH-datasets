# SGAH-datasets.
## Introduction.
This dataset is logged at State Grid Corporation of China.  
The dataset contains four types fault and one normal data.  
Each fault data contains 100 sampling points of three-phase voltage and current data.  
## Explanation of fault type.
### Single-phase Grounding Fault.  
Fault phase current increases and fault phase voltage decreases.

### Two-phase Grounding Fault.  
Fault two-phase current increases, the voltage decreases, and the two fault phases have opposite currents.
